              "   'description': \"What is Python? Executive Summary Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.   Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.  What is Python? Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.  It is used for:  web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.  What can Python do?  Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.  Why Python?  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.  Good to know  The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.  Python Syntax compared to other programming languages  Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.  Applications for Python  Python is used in many application domains. Here's a sampling.  The Python Package Index lists thousands of third party modules for Python.  Web and Internet Development  Python offers many choices for web development:  Frameworks such as Django and Pyramid. Micro-frameworks such as Flask and Bottle. Advanced content management systems such as Plone and django CMS.  Python's standard library supports many Internet protocols:  HTML and XML JSON E-mail processing. Support for FTP, IMAP, and other Internet protocols. Easy-to-use socket interface.  And the Package Index has yet more libraries:  Requests, a powerful HTTP client library. Beautiful Soup, an HTML parser that can handle all sorts of oddball HTML. Feedparser for parsing RSS/Atom feeds. Paramiko, implementing the SSH2 protocol. Twisted Python, a framework for asynchronous network programming.  Scientific and Numeric  Python is widely used in scientific and numeric computing:  SciPy is a collection of packages for mathematics, science, and engineering.  Pandas is a data analysis and modeling library. IPython is a powerful interactive shell that features easy editing and recording of a work session, and supports visualizations and parallel computing.  The Software Carpentry Course teaches basic skills for scientific computing, running bootcamps and providing open-access teaching materials. Education Python is a superb language for teaching programming, both at the introductory level and in more advanced courses.  Books such as How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science, and Practical Programming. The Education Special Interest Group is a good place to discuss teaching issues. Desktop GUIs The Tk GUI library is included with most binary distributions of Python.  Some toolkits that are usable on several platforms are available separately:  wxWidgets Kivy, for writing multitouch applications. Qt via pyqt or pyside Platform-specific toolkits are also available:  GTK+ Microsoft Foundation Classes through the win32 extensions Software Development Python is often used as a support language for software developers, for build control and management, testing, and in many other ways.  SCons for build control.  Buildbot and Apache Gump for automated continuous compilation and testing. Roundup or Trac for bug tracking and project management. Business Applications Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems:  Odoo is an all-in-one management software that offers a range of business applications that form a complete suite of enterprise management applications. Try ton is a three-tier high-level general purpose application platform.\",\n",

              "   'description': '    Course: CSE425 - Concepts of Programming Language  Instructor’s Name: Adjunct Associate Professor Kamruddin Nur  Section: 04  Assignment: Implement searching on the given data (NCHS_-_Leading_Causes_of_Death__United_States) in Comma Separated File Format  Language Used: Shell script(mandatory), C plus plus(optional), Python(optional)  Submission Deadline: 15th December, 2019  Student’s Name: Md. Mahmudul Haque  Id No. : 1511944642  The code of the assignment that I have implemented are on three languages and before hopping into the contrast and comparison of those languages I am here giving a brief description on my procedure of coding.  I used string searching Users are offered to search on their preference of column value While a match is found the program will return the entire row of that file I used for and while loop to search for the specific string that user might look for Exceptions are handled in C plus plus and Python whereas I used if else statement to handle exception in Shell Script Aliasing are used Type casting have been used in Python Concatenation of strings are used in all the languages.  Now let’s see what are the comparison and contrast between the codes of those languages!  Shell script:  Key Points of my Code Description #no libraries needed to import! And no curly braces In shell script no libraries are needed to import explicitly. So it is indicating that this programming language is more easy to write and read for the non-programmers also. And for the curly braces, to implement the code, prior knowledge is required. while:  #no condition More liberal while handling loop. Needs user interruption or programmer’s sentinels to stop infinity cycle. If else fi, case….esac, do… done To indicate the end of if-else block I have to write ‘fi’ term after each if-else block and similar happened to case … esac term under the case block and do … done block. Not readable and to write, one has to have prior knowledge. No need to declare the type of variables In Shell Script the type of variables are not needed to be declared by the programmer explicitly. So it is loosely typed and checking runtime. And least reliable. ‘ ;; ’ after every case block To mark the end of each case Shell script needs to be said the ‘ ;; ’ . *  state in case block This is indicating the general block of case if the options does not match then this block will be operated. Not so readable. foo = foo + ‘,’ Or foo = ‘,’ + foo + ‘,’   Easy to concatenate, so easy to write. Also orthogonal. No exception handling I used if else fi instead.  C plus plus(C++):  Key Points of my Code Description #include <bits/stdc++.h> Libraries are needed to be declared explicitly. Different than Shell Script and Python. using namespace std It is used to indicate the compiler that the standard naming convention of c++ is being used. So it is more strict in terms of language building block. Different than Shell Script and Python. int main() { …. } To execute the whole code the code must be in between the curly braces of main function block. So this is supporting abstraction. Also the statements are compound and understandable if C is known. Different than Shell Script and Python. Type checking; example - string year; Usually check the type during compile time and strongly typed. Different than Shell Script. But python is loosely typed. while(1){ .. } To operate the while loop, the coder must at least need to assign it to a true value. Expressive and writeable though always need to have some knowledge on c++ before writing code using it. Also compound. Different than Shell Script and Python. ifstream Working as a input stream to read the file. Type and work specified. Similar to Python and Shell Script try{ …if(inFile) else throw “....” }  catch(const char* e){ … }  To handle exception, c++ has some built in library to handle it and user either can define or not to about the variation of exception he/she wants to handle. The try block is used as experiment part whereas the catch block will catch if there is no such file according to my code. Compound with form and meaning. Almost similar to Python but Shell script does not have this facility. bool flag This is indicating that c++ is capable of using concised parameters in terms of programming paradigm. But not orthogonal as I have to handle boolean value all the time. Similar to Python in some case but Shell Script does not have it. cout or cin Capable of printing and taking input through object as c++ allows object oriented programming whereas Python also support this.  Python:  Key Points of my Code Description flag = True Boolean data type exists and so it is concise which is similar to C++ but Shell Script does not have this print() Capable of procedural, functional, and object oriented job. C++ is almost similar but Shell script is totally different here. try:     ….. except Exception:     ……. To handle exception, python has some built in library to handle it and user either can define or not to about the variation of exception he/she wants to handle. The try block is used as experiment part whereas the catch block will catch if there is no such file according to my code. Compound with form and meaning like C++. file = open(\"NCHS_-_Leading_Causes_of_Death__United_States.csv\") Python allows aliasing whereas C++ uses referencing in alias. with file: ... Helpful while handling files. Do not need to reopen and close the file every time. C++ also have similar to this but in stream format. But Shell script is more better in handling files option = input() option = int(option) Allows type checking like C++ but loosely typed like Shell script if... elif... Have conditional statements which are also in C++ and Shell Script   Conclusion:  So far according to my knowledge, I found out that while interacting with file Shell script is much more easier but also Python gives a good file handling libraries now like: Pandas and C++ is more prone to let user follow the programming paradigm while handling files.',\n",

              "   'description': 'ANALYZING ROAD SAFETY & TRAFFIC DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE UK (Multi-class Classification) SUMMARY Here, I am aim to analyze the Road Safety and Traffic Demographics dataset (UK), containing accidents reported by the police between the years of 2004 - 2017.  PROJECT GOALS: Identify factors responsible for most of the reported accidents. Build a machine learning model that is capable of accurately predicting the severity of an accident. Provide recommendations to the Department of Transport (UK Government), to improve road safety policies and prevent recurrences of severe accidents where possible. PACKAGES USED: Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, imblearn (imbalanced-learn), seaborn, Matplotlib MOTIVATION World Health Organization (WHO) reported that more than 1.25 million people die each year while 50 million are injured as a result of road accidents worldwide. Road accidents are the 10th leading cause of death globally. On current trends, road traffic accidents are to become the 7th leading cause of death by 2030 making it a major public health concern. Between the years 2005 and 2016, there were roughly 2 million road accidents reported in the United Kingdom (UK) alone of which 16,000 were fatal.  As a big data project, I wanted to explore the traffic demographics data in greater detail using machine learning!  CONTEXT The UK government amassed traffic data from 2004 to 2017, recording over 2 million accidents in the process and making this one of the most comprehensive traffic data sets out there. It\\'s a huge picture of a country undergoing change.  Note that all the contained accident data comes from police reports, so this data does not include minor incidents.  For steps undertaken to pre-process and clean the data, please view the \"Data Cleansing & Descriptive Analysis_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS (EDA) Tools used include Python, Tableau, MS PowerBI Percent (%) distribution of target classes Percent dist of Accident Severity  As seen above, the data is highly imbalanced.  For detailed steps undertaken to deal with the imbalanced data, please view the \"Modelling_Predictive Analytics_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file. This article provides some great tips on utilizing the correct performance metrics when analyzing a models performance trained on an imbalanced dataset.  This article describes several strategies that can help combat the case of a severly imbalanced dataset. Methods include:  Resampling strategies (under - Tomek Links, Cluster Centroids, over sampling - SMOTE) Using Decision Tree based models Using Cost-Sensitive training (Penalize algorithms) Number of accidents by Year and Accident Severity Total accidents by year and severity  It can be seen above that the trend seems to be increasing as the years go. In addition, the spike between 2008 - 2009 was because of a enhancement in the reporting system introduced in the UK in 2009, where all accident including minor accidents needed to be reported by the police so as to match the counts represented by hospitals, insurance claims etc.  Accidents density by Location geomap  Most accidents took place in major cities - Birmingham, London, leeds, Newcastle  Accidents by Gender and Age Accidents by gender and age  Accidents by Day of the week and Year Accidents by year and weekday  Most accidents take place on a Friday  Vehicle Manoever at time of accident Vehicle Manoever at time of accident  Most accidents take place as a result of overtaking  For more findings, please go to the \"Images\" folder. For steps undertaken to carry out some predictive modeling and hyper-parameter tuning, please view the \"Modelling_Predictive Analytics_UK Traffic Demographics.ipynb\" file. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORT (UK) Decrease emergency response times during afternoon rush-hours (15-19) especially on Fridays. Allocate resources to investigate high density traffic points and identify new infrastructure needs to divert traffic from dual-carriage ways. Explore conditions of vehicles and casualties such as vehicle type, age of vehicles registered, pedestrian movements, etc. for policy makers. Adopt comprehensive distracted driving laws that increase penalties for drivers who commit traffic violations like aggressive overtaking. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The license for this dataset is the Open Givernment Licence used by all data on data.gov.uk. The raw datasets are available from the UK Department of Transport website.  I had a lot of fun working on this dataset and learned a lot in the process. I plan to further my research in the area of predictive modeling using imabalanced data and how to effectively build a highly robust model for future projects.

              "   'description': \"Trends-in-Programming-Languages We’re always staying on the pulse of the software development industry so that we can better prepare our students for rapidly – changing technology job market. Many of the students and developers in general are interested in working at top startups and tech companies. How can we tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing, and which are shrinking so that we can tell which are most worth investing time in?  One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, we can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. We're going to use open data from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and JavaScript have changed over time.  Each Stack Overflow question has a tag, which marks a question to describe its topic or technology. For instance, there's a tag for languages like R or Python, and for packages like ggplot2 or pandas.  The dataset used, contains one observation for each tag in a year. The dataset also includes both the number of questions asked in that tag in the year and the total number of questions asked in that year Rather than just the counts of the tags, the concern here is the percentage change: the fraction of questions that year have that tag  What are the most asked - about tags? It's sure been fun to visualize and compare tags over time. The dplyr and ggplot2 tags may not have as many questions as R, but we can tell they're both growing quickly as well.  We might like to know which tags have the most questions overall, not just within a particular year.  #The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third-party vendors. Popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, Amazon, YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written. (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)  Comparing R and Python There is a lot of heated discussion over the topic, but there are some great, thoughtful articles as well. Some suggest Python is preferable as a general-purpose programming language, while others suggest data science is better served by a dedicated language and toolchain. The origins and development arcs of the two languages are compared, often to support differing conclusions.  For individual data scientists, some common points to consider:  • Python is a great general programming language, with many libraries dedicated to data science. • Many (if not most) general introductory programming courses start teaching with Python now. • Python is the go-to language for many ETL and Machine Learning workflows. • Many (if not most) introductory courses to statistics and data science teach R now. • R has become the world’s largest repository of statistical knowledge with reference implementations for thousands, if not tens of thousands, of algorithms that have been vetted by experts. The documentation for many R packages includes links to the primary literature on the subject. • R has a very low barrier to entry for doing exploratory analysis, and converting that work into a great report, dashboard, or API. • R with RStudio is often considered the best place to do exploratory data analysis.

The Pandas module is a high performance, highly efficient, and high level data analysis library.  At its core, it is very much like operating a headless version of a spreadsheet, like Excel. Most of the datasets you work with will be what are called dataframes. You may be familiar with this term already, it is used across other languages, but, if not, a dataframe is most often just like a spreadsheet. Columns and rows, that's all there is to it! From here, we can utilize Pandas to perform operations on our data sets at lightning speeds.\",\n",

              "   'description': 'This project has been developed to provide decision support to all Program managers who manage multiple projects with shared resources that are, of course, planned by the various project managers assigned. Therefore, there is a vertical communication between the Program Manager and the various reference project managers in which the latter give precisely the planning of their project to the program manager. The stage I decided to focus on is post planning. One of the most difficult problems to deal with is to manage human resources linked to multiple projects, and then shared resources. Then, you can analyse whether a given resource may be abnormally allocated across multiple projects, or if you are straddling multiple immediately subsequent critical tasks related to both the single project and the N-projects on which it is allocated. To try to solve these problems, I decided to develop a software by following the approach of data analysis through the Critical Path Method (CPM). The tools used to develop the software are: Neo4j and PyCharm, languages: Cypher and Python, libraries: pandas and py2neo',\n",

              "   'description': \"For Data Analysts and Data Scientists, Python has many advantages. A huge range of open-source libraries make it an incredibly useful tool for any Data Analyst.  We have pandas, NumPy and Vaex for data analysis, Matplotlib, seaborn and Bokeh for visualisation, and TensorFlow, scikit-learn and PyTorch for machine learning applications (plus many, many more).  With its (relatively) easy learning curve and versatility, it's no wonder that Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages out there.  So if we're using Python for data analysis, it's worth asking - where does all this data come from?  While there is a massive variety of sources for datasets, in many cases - particularly in enterprise businesses - data is going to be stored in a relational database. Relational databases are an extremely efficient, powerful and widely-used way to create, read, update and delete data of all kinds.  The most widely used relational database management systems (RDBMSs) - Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2 - all use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access and make changes to the data.  Note that each RDBMS uses a slightly different flavour of SQL, so SQL code written for one will usually not work in another without (normally fairly minor) modifications. But the concepts, structures and operations are largely identical.  This means for a working Data Analyst, a strong understanding of SQL is hugely important. Knowing how to use Python and SQL together will give you even more of an advantage when it comes to working with your data.\",\n",

With the fast moving lives, the consumers absolutely have no time to stand in long queues in order to get their work done.  In this video, we can learn how to develop an Auto Billing Manager using, Tkinter; a standard GUI Library for Python. The App has also got automated teller system so as to automatically bill the products put into them and the final bill is sent to a printer for printout.  Automation, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies, has opened up new possibilities. The pace of adoption has been rapid. Institutions of all sizes globally are leveraging automation to drive value. Based on Statistics and Research, 57% of 1,300 institutions have already started on this journey, with another 18% planning to kick off something within the next phase. When it comes to **AI programming languages**, Python leads the pack with its unparalleled community support and pre-built libraries (like Tkinter, NumPy, Pandas, Pybrain, and SciPy) that help expedite AI development *Artificial Intelligence* is a way of making a computer, **a computer-controlled robot**, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. The programming language is used globally to design and build 2D imaging software like Inkscape, GIMP, Paint Shop Pro, and Scribus. Also, Python is used in several 3D animation packages such as Blender, Houdini, 3ds Max, Maya, Cinema 4D, and Lightwave, to name a few. • Web Development.
